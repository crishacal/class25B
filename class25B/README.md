# Simple React Posts Viewer

This is a basic React application that fetches and displays a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. It demonstrates the use of React hooks like useState and useEffect for data fetching, along with custom CSS styling for a modern, dark-themed user interface.

## Features

- Displays each post with its ID, title, and body in a card-like layout.
- Responsive design with hover effects for better user interaction.
- Dark mode theme by default, with centered content and flexible spacing.
